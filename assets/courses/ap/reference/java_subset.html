  <h2><br>
  The AP Java Subset</h2>
  <font color="#000000"><p>The AP Java subset is intended to outline the features of Java
  that may appear on<i> </i>AP Computer Science Examinations. The AP Java subset is NOT
  intended as an overall prescription for computer science courses &#151; the subset itself
  will need to be supplemented in order to cover a typical introductory curriculum. For
  example, I/O is essential to programming and can be done in many different ways. Because
  of this, specific I/O features are not tested on the AP Computer Science Exam.</font> </p>
  <p><font color="#000000">This document describes the Java subset that students will be
  expected to understand when they take the AP Computer Science Exam. A number of features
  are also mentioned that are potentially relevant in a CS1/2 course but are not
  specifically tested on the AP Computer Science Exam.</font> </p>
  <p><font color="#000000">When formulating the subset, we were guided by three principles:</font>
  <ol>
    <li><font color="#000000">Enable the test designers to formulate meaningful questions.</font>
    </li>
    <li><font color="#000000">Help students with test preparation.</font> </li>
    <li><font color="#000000">Enable instructors to follow a variety of approaches in their
      courses.</font> </li>
  </ol>
  <font color="#000000"><p>To help students with test preparation, the AP Java subset was
  intentionally kept small. We omitted language constructs and library features that did not
  add significant functionality and that can, for the formulation of exam questions, be
  expressed by other mechanisms in the subset. For example, inner classes or the <tt>StringBuffer</tt>
  class are not essential for the formulation of exam questions &#151; the exam uses
  alternatives that can be easily understood by students. Of course, these constructs add
  significant value for programming. Omission of a feature from the AP Java subset does <i>not</i>
  imply any judgment that the feature is inferior or not worthwhile.</font> </p>
  <p align="left"><font color="#000000">The AP Java subset gives instructors flexibility in
  how they use Java in their courses. For example, some courses teach how to perform
  input/output using streams or readers/writers, others teach graphical user interface
  construction, and yet others rely on a tool or library that handles input/output. For the
  purpose of the AP Computer Science Exam, these choices are incidental and are not central
  for the mastery of computer science concepts. The AP Java subset does not address handling
  of user input at all. That means that the subset is <i>not complete</i>. To create actual
  programs, instructors need to present additional mechanisms in their classes.</font> </p>
  <p><font color="#000000">The following section contains the language features that may be
  tested on the AP Computer Science Exam.&nbsp; Following that is a section specifying which
  Standard Java classes and methods will be used on the exam. There will be no extra AP
  classes provided as part of the subset. A summary table is provided that outlines the
  features that are tested on the A and AB exams, the AB exam only, and those features that
  are useful but are not tested on either exam.</font> </p>
  <blockquote>
    <h3><font color="#000000">Language Features</font></h3>
    <ol>
      <li><font color="#000000">Primitive types:<tt> int</tt>,<tt> double</tt>,<tt> boolean </tt>are
        part of the AP Java subset.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">The other primitive types<tt> short</tt>,<tt> long</tt>,<tt> byte</tt>,<tt>
        char</tt>, and<tt> float </tt>are not in the subset. In particular, students need not be
        aware that strings are composed of <tt>char</tt> values. Introducing<tt> char </tt>does
        not increase the expressiveness of the subset. Students already need to understand string
        concatenation,<tt> String.substring </tt>and<tt> String.equals</tt>.<tt> </tt>Not
        introducing<tt> char </tt>avoids complexities with the<tt> char</tt>/<tt>int </tt>conversions
        and confusion between<tt> &quot;x&quot; </tt>and<tt> 'x'</tt>.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Arithmetic operators:<tt> +</tt>,<tt> -</tt>,<tt> *</tt>,<tt> /</tt>,<tt>
        % </tt>are part of the AP Java subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Increment/decrement operator:<tt> ++</tt>,<tt> -- </tt>are part of
        the AP Java subset.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">These operators are used only for their <i>side effect</i>, not for
        their value. That is, the postfix form (e.g.,<tt> x++</tt>)<tt> </tt>is always used, and
        the operators are not used inside other expressions. For example,<tt> a[x++] </tt>is not
        used.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">The assignment operator<tt> = </tt>is part of the AP Java subset.</font>
        <br>
        <font color="#000000">The combined arithmetic/assignment operators<tt> +=</tt>,<tt> -=</tt>,<tt>
        *=</tt>,<tt> /=</tt>,<tt> %= </tt>are part of the AP Java subset although they are used
        simply as a shorthand and will not be used in the adjustment part of a for loop.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Relational operators<tt> ==</tt>,<tt> !=</tt>,<tt> &lt;</tt>,<tt>
        &lt;=</tt>,<tt> &gt;</tt>,<tt> &gt;= </tt>are part of the AP Java subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Logical operations<tt> &amp;&amp;</tt>,<tt> ||</tt>,<tt> ! </tt>are
        part of the AP Java subset. Students need to understand the &quot;short circuit&quot;
        evaluation of the<tt> &amp;&amp; </tt>and<tt> || </tt>operators.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">The logical<tt> &amp;</tt>,<tt> | </tt>and<tt> ^ </tt>and the bit
        operators<tt> &lt;&lt;</tt>,<tt> &gt;&gt;</tt>,<tt> &gt;&gt;&gt;</tt>,<tt> &amp;</tt>,<tt>
        ~</tt>,<tt> |</tt>,<tt> ^ </tt>are not in the subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">The ternary<tt> ?: </tt>operator is not in the subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">The numeric casts<tt> (int) </tt>and<tt> (double) </tt>are&nbsp;
        part of the AP Java subset.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">Since the only primitive types in the subset are<tt> int</tt>,<tt>
        double</tt>,<tt> </tt>and<tt> boolean</tt>,<tt> </tt>the only required numeric casts are
        the cast <tt>(int) </tt>and the cast<tt> (double)</tt>.&nbsp; Students are expected to
        understand &quot;truncation towards 0&quot; behavior as well as the fact that positive
        floating-point numbers can be rounded to the nearest integer as<tt> (int)(x + 0.5)</tt>,<tt>
        </tt>negative numbers as <tt>(int)(x - 0.5)</tt>.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">String concatenation<tt> + </tt>is part of the AP Java subset.
        Students are expected to know that concatenation converts numbers to strings and invokes<tt>
        toString </tt>on objects.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">String concatenation can be less efficient than using the<tt>
        StringBuffer </tt>class. However, for greater simplicity and conceptual clarity, the<tt>
        StringBuffer </tt>class is not in the subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">The escape sequences inside strings<tt> \\</tt>,<tt> \&quot;</tt>,<tt>
        \n </tt>are part of the AP Java subset.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">The<tt> \t </tt>escape and Unicode<tt> \uxxxx </tt>escapes are not
        in the subset. The<tt> \' </tt>escape is only necessary inside character literals and is
        not in the subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">User input is not part of the AP Java subset.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">There are many possible ways for supplying user input; e.g., by
        reading from a<tt> BufferedReader </tt>that is wrapped around<tt> System.in</tt>, reading
        from a stream (such as a file or an URL), or from a dialog box. There are advantages and
        disadvantages to the various approaches. In particular, reading from<tt> System.in </tt>is
        both fraught with complexities (two nested readers and the handling of checked exceptions)
        and considered old fashioned by some instructors. The exam does not prescribe any one
        approach. Instead, if reading input is necessary, it will be indicated in a way similar to
        the following:</font> <pre><tt><font color="#000000">double x = <i>call to a method that reads a floating-point number</i>;</font></tt></pre>
        <p><font color="#000000">or</font> </p>
        <pre><tt><font color="#000000">double x = IO.readDouble(); // read user input</font></tt></pre>
        <p><font color="#000000">Processing string input (e.g., with<tt> StringTokenizer</tt>)<tt>
        </tt>and converting strings to numeric values (e.g., with<tt> Integer.parseInt</tt>) is
        not in the subset.</font> </p>
      </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Testing of output is restricted to<tt> System.out.print </tt>and<tt>
        System.out.println</tt>.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">As with user input, there are many possible ways for directing the
        output of a program, for example to<tt> System.out</tt>,<tt> </tt>to a file, or to a text
        area in a graphical user interface. The AP Java subset includes the ability to print
        output to<tt> System.out</tt>,<tt> </tt>because it makes it easy to formulate questions.
        Since most graphical environments allow printing of debug messages to<tt> System.out </tt>(with
        output being collected in a special window, e.g. the &quot;Java console&quot; in a
        browser), students are usually familiar with this method of producing output.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">Formatted output (e.g., with<tt> NumberFormat</tt>)<tt> </tt>is not
        in the subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">The<tt> main </tt>method and command-line arguments are not in the
        subset.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">Not all students are familiar with the use of the<tt> main </tt>method.
        Common alternate methods for invoking programs include applets, extending an
        instructor-provided framework, or using an environment such as BlueJ. The AP Computer
        Science Exam does not prescribe any particular approach for program invocation. In
        free-response questions, students are not expected to invoke programs. In case studies,
        program invocation with<tt> main </tt>may occur, but the<tt> main </tt>method will be kept
        very simple.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Arrays: one-dimensional arrays and two-dimensional rectangular
        arrays are part of the AP Java subset. Both arrays of primitive types (e.g.,<tt> int[] </tt>and
        arrays of objects (e.g.,<tt> Student[]</tt>)are in the subset. Initialization of named
        arrays (<tt>int[] a = { 1, 2, 3 };</tt>)<tt> </tt>is part of the AP Java subset.</font> <br>
        <font color="#000000">Arrays with more than two dimensions (e.g.,<tt> rubik = new
        Color[3][3][3]</tt>) are not in the subset. &quot;Ragged&quot; arrays (e.g.,<tt> new
        int[3][]</tt>)<tt> </tt>are not in the subset. In particular, students do not need to know
        that an<tt> int[3][3] </tt>really is an &quot;array of arrays&quot; whose rows can be
        replaced with other<tt> int[] </tt>arrays. However, students are expected to know that<tt>
        a[0].length </tt>is the number of columns in a rectangular two-dimensional array <tt>a</tt>.
        Anonymous arrays (e.g.,<tt> new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }</tt>) are not in the subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">The control structures<tt> if</tt>,<tt> if/else</tt>,<tt> while</tt>,<tt>
        for</tt>,<tt> return </tt>are part of the AP Java subset. The<tt> do/while</tt>,<tt>
        switch</tt>,<tt> </tt>plain and labeled<tt> break </tt>and<tt> continue </tt>statements
        are not in the subset.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Method overloading (e.g.<tt> MyClass.foo(String s) </tt>and<tt>
        MyClass.foo(int n)</tt>)<tt> </tt>is part of the AP Java subset. Students should
        understand that the signature of a method depends on the number, types, and order of its
        parameters but does not include the return type of the method.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Classes: Students are expected to construct objects with the<tt>
        new </tt>operator, to supply construction parameters, and to invoke accessor and modifier
        methods. For the A exam, students are expected to modify existing classes (by adding or
        modifying methods and instance variables). For the AB exam, students are expected to
        design their own classes.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Visibility: In the AP Java subset, all classes are<tt> public</tt>.<tt>
        </tt>All instance variables are<tt> private</tt>. Methods, constructors, and constants<tt>

        Students are required to understand when the use of<tt> static </tt>methods is
        appropriate.</fon>
<HR><H3>Transfer interrupted!</H3>
>In the exam,<tt> static </tt>methods are always invoked through a

      <li><font color="#000000">The use of<tt> this </tt>is restricted to passing the implicit
        parameter in its entirety to another method (e.g.,<tt> obj.method(this)</tt>) and to
        descriptions such as &quot;the implicit parameter<tt> this</tt>&quot;. Using<tt> this.var </tt>or<tt>
        this.method(args) </tt>is not in the subset. In particular, students are not required to
        know the idiom<tt> &quot;this.var = var&quot;</tt>,<tt> </tt>where<tt> var </tt>is both
        the name of an instance variable and a parameter variable.</font> <br>

        (i.e.,<tt> super.method(args)</tt>)<tt> </tt>may be tested on the AB exam.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Students need to be able to implement constructors that initialize

        inheritance that includes understanding the concepts of method overriding and polymorphism
        as well as the ability to modify existing subclasses. On the AB exam, students are
        expected to implement their own subclasses.</font> </li>
      <li><font color="#000000">Students are expected to be able to read the definitions of
        interfaces and abstract classes and understand that the abstract methods need to be
