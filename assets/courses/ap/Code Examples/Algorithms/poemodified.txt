THE Cask of Amontillado
Edgar Allan Poe

THE thousand injuries of Fortunato I had borne as I best could 
but when he ventured upon insult I vowed revenge  You  who so well
know THE nature of my soul  will not suppose  however  that I gave
utterance to a threat  At length I would be avenged; this was
a point definitively settled-but THE very definitiveness with
which it was resolved precluded THE idea of risk  I must not only
punish but punish with impunity  A wrong is unredressed when retribution
overtakes its redresser  It is equally unredressed when THE avenger
fails to make himself felt as such to him who has done THE wrong 

It must be understood that neiTHEr by word nor deed had I given
Fortunato cause to doubt my good will  I continued  as was my wont 
to smile in his face  and he did not perceive that my smile now
was at THE thought of his immolation 

He had a weak point-this Fortunato-although in oTHEr regards
he was a man to be respected and even feared  He prided himself
upon his connoisseurship in wine  Few Italians have THE true virtuoso
spirit  For THE most part THEir enthusiasm is adopted to suit THE
time and opportunity  to practice imposture upon THE British and
Austrian millionaires  In painting and gemmary  Fortunato  like
his countrymen  was a quack  but in THE matter of old wines he
was sincere  In this respect I did not differ from him materially;-I
was skilful in THE Italian vintages myself  and bought largely
whenever I could 

It was about dusk  one evening during THE supreme madness of THE
carnival season  that I encountered my friend  He accosted me with
excessive warmth  for he had been drinking much  THE man wore motley 
He had on a tight-fitting parti-striped dress  and his head was
surmounted by THE conical cap and bells  I was so pleased to see
him that I should never have done wringing his hand 

I said to him-  My dear Fortunato  you are luckily met  How remarkably
well you are looking to-day  But I have received a pipe of what
passes for Amontillado  and I have my doubts   

  How    said he    Amontillado  A pipe  Impossible  And in THE
middle of THE carnival   

  I have my doubts    I replied;   and I was silly enough to pay
THE full Amontillado price without consulting you in THE matter 
You were not to be found  and I was fearful of losing a bargain   

  Amontillado   

  I have my doubts   

  Amontillado   

  And I must satisfy THEm   

  Amontillado   

  As you are engaged  I am on my way to Luchresi  If any one has
a critical turn it is he  He will tell me--  

  Luchresi cannot tell Amontillado from Sherry   

  And yet some fools will have it that his taste is a match for
your own   

  Come  let us go   

  WhiTHEr   

  To your vaults   

  My friend  no; I will not impose upon your good nature  I perceive
you have an engagement  Luchresi--  

  I have no engagement;-come   

  My friend  no  It is not THE engagement  but THE severe cold
with which I perceive you are afflicted  THE vaults are insufferably
damp  THEy are encrusted with nitre   

  Let us go  neverTHEless  THE cold is merely nothing  Amontillado 
You have been imposed upon  And as for Luchresi  he cannot distinguish
Sherry from Amontillado   

Thus speaking  Fortunato possessed himself of my arm; and putting
on a mask of black silk and drawing a roquelaire closely about
my person  I suffered him to hurry me to my palazzo 

THEre were no attendants at home; THEy had absconded to make merry
in honour of THE time  I had told THEm that I should not return
until THE morning  and had given THEm explicit orders not to stir
from THE house  THEse orders were sufficient  I well knew  to insure
THEir immediate disappearance  one and all  as soon as my back
was turned 

I took from THEir sconces two flambeaux  and giving one to Fortunato 
bowed him through several suites of rooms to THE archway that led
into THE vaults  I passed down a long and winding staircase  requesting
him to be cautious as he followed  We came at length to THE foot
of THE descent  and stood togeTHEr upon THE damp ground of THE
catacombs of THE Montresors 

THE gait of my friend was unsteady  and THE bells upon his cap
jingled as he strode 

  THE pipe    said he 

  It is farTHEr on    said I;   but observe THE white web-work
which gleams from THEse cavern walls   

He turned towards me  and looked into my eyes with two filmy orbs
that distilled THE rheum of intoxication 

  Nitre    he asked  at length 

  Nitre    I replied    How long have you had that cough   

  Ugh  ugh  ugh -ugh  ugh  ugh -ugh  ugh  ugh -ugh  ugh  ugh -ugh 
ugh  ugh   

My poor friend found it impossible to reply for many minutes 

  It is nothing    he said  at last 

  Come    I said  with decision    we will go back; your health
is precious  You are rich  respected  admired  beloved; you are
happy  as once I was  You are a man to be missed  For me it is
no matter  We will go back; you will be ill  and I cannot be responsible 
Besides  THEre is Luchresi--  

  Enough    he said;   THE cough is a mere nothing; it will not
kill me  I shall not die of a cough   

  True-true    I replied;   and  indeed  I had no intention of
alarming you unneccessarily-but you should use all proper caution 
A draught of this Medoc will defend us from THE damps   

Here I knocked off THE neck of a bottle which I drew from a long
row of its fellows that lay upon THE mould 

  Drink    I said  presenting him THE wine 

He raised it to his lips with a leer  He paused and nodded to me
familiarly  while his bells jingled 

  I drink    he said    to THE buried that repose around us   

  And I to your long life   

He again took my arm  and we proceeded 

  THEse vaults    he said    are extensive   

  THE Montresors    I replied    were a great and numerous family   

  I forget your arms   

  A huge human foot d or  in a field azure; THE foot crushes a
serpent rampant whose fangs are imbedded in THE heel   

  And THE motto   

  Nemo me impune lacessit   

  Good    he said 

THE wine sparkled in his eyes and THE bells jingled  My own fancy
grew warm with THE Medoc  We had passed through long walls of piled
skeletons  with casks and puncheons intermingling  into THE inmost
recesses of THE catacombs  I paused again  and this time I made
bold to seize Fortunato by an arm above THE elbow 

  THE nitre    I said;   see  it increases  It hangs like moss
upon THE vaults  We are below THE river s bed  THE drops of moisture
trickle among THE bones  Come  we will go back ere it is too late 
Your cough--  

  It is nothing    he said;   let us go on  But first  anoTHEr
draught of THE Medoc   

I broke and reached him a flacon of De Grave  He emptied
it at a breath  His eyes flashed with a fierce light  He laughed
and threw THE bottle upwards with a gesticulation I did not understand 

I looked at him in surprise  He repeated THE movement-a grotesque
one 

  You do not comprehend    he said 

  Not I    I replied 

  THEn you are not of THE broTHErhood   

  How   

  You are not of THE masons   

  Yes  yes    I said;   yes  yes   

  You  Impossible  A mason   

  A mason    I replied 

  A sign    he said    a sign   

  It is this    I answered producing from beneath THE folds of
my roquelaire a trowel 

  You jest    he exclaimed  recoiling a few paces    But let us
proceed to THE Amontillado   

  Be it so    I said  replacing THE tool beneath THE cloak and
again offering him my arm  He leaned upon it heavily  We continued
our rout in search of THE Amontillado  We passed through a range
of low arches  descended  passed on  and descending again  arrived
at a deep crypt  in which THE foulness of THE air caused our flambeaux
raTHEr to glow than flame 

At THE most remote end of THE crypt THEre appeared anoTHEr less
spacious  Its walls had been lined with human remains  piled to
THE vault overhead  in THE fashion of THE great catacombs of Paris 
Three sides of this interior crypt were still ornamented in this
manner  From THE fourth side THE bones had been thrown down  and
lay promiscuously upon THE earth  forming at one point a mound
of some size  Within THE wall thus exposed by THE displacing of
THE bones  we perceived a still interior crypt or recess  in depth
about four feet  in width three  in height six or seven  It seemed
to have been constructed for no especial use within itself  but
formed merely THE interval between two of THE colossal supports
of THE roof of THE catacombs  and was backed by one of THEir circumscribing
walls of solid granite 

It was in vain that Fortunato  uplifting his dull torch  endeavoured
to pry into THE depth of THE recess  Its termination THE feeble
light did not enable us to see 

  Proceed    I said;   herein is THE Amontillado  As for Luchresi--  

  He is an ignoramus    interrupted my friend  as he stepped unsteadily
forward  while I followed immediately at his heels  In an instant
he had reached THE extremity of THE niche  and finding his progress
arrested by THE rock  stood stupidly bewildered  A moment more
and I had fettered him to THE granite  In its surface were two
iron staples  distant from each oTHEr about two feet  horizontally 
From one of THEse depended a short chain  from THE oTHEr a padlock 
Throwing THE links about his waist  it was but THE work of a few
seconds to secure it  He was too much astounded to resist  Withdrawing
THE key I stepped back from THE recess 

  Pass your hand    I said    over THE wall; you cannot help feeling
THE nitre  Indeed  it is very damp  Once more let me implore
you to return  No  THEn I must positively leave you  But I will
first render you all THE little attentions in my power   

  THE Amontillado    ejaculated my friend  not yet recovered from
his astonishment 

  True    I replied;   THE Amontillado   

As I said THEse words I busied myself among THE pile of bones of
which I have before spoken  Throwing THEm aside  I soon uncovered
a quantity of building stone and mortar  With THEse materials and
with THE aid of my trowel  I began vigorously to wall up THE entrance
of THE niche 

I had scarcely laid THE first tier of THE masonry when I discovered
that THE intoxication of Fortunato had in great measure worn off 
THE earliest indication I had of this was a low moaning cry from
THE depth of THE recess  It was not THE cry of a drunken man 
THEre was THEn a long and obstinate silence  I laid THE second
tier  and THE third  and THE fourth; and THEn I heard THE furious
vibration of THE chain  THE noise lasted for several minutes  during
which  that I might hearken to it with THE more satisfaction  I
ceased my labours and sat down upon THE bones  When at last THE
clanking subsided  I resumed THE trowel  and finished without interruption
THE fifth  THE sixth  and THE seventh tier  THE wall was now nearly
upon a level with my breast  I again paused  and holding THE flambeaux
over THE mason-work  threw a few feeble rays upon THE figure within 

A succession of loud and shrill screams  bursting suddenly from
THE throat of THE chained form  seemed to thrust me violently back 
For a brief moment I hesitated  I trembled  Unsheathing my rapier 
I began to grope with it about THE recess; but THE thought of an
instant reassured me  I placed my hand upon THE solid fabric of
THE catacombs and felt satisfied  I reapproached THE wall  I replied
to THE yells of him who clamoured  I reechoed  I aided  I surpassed
THEm in volume and in strength  I did this  and THE clamourer grew
still 

It was now midnight  and my task was drawing to a close  I had
completed THE eighth  THE ninth and THE tenth tier  I had finished
a portion of THE last and THE eleventh; THEre remained but a single
stone to be fitted and plastered in  I struggled with its weight;
I placed it partially in its destined position  But now THEre came
from out THE niche a low laugh that erected THE hairs upon my head 
It was succeeded by a sad voice  which I had difficulty in recognizing
as that of THE noble Fortunato  THE voice said-

  Ha  ha  ha -he  he  he -a very good joke  indeed-an excellent
jest  We will have many a rich laugh about it at THE palazzo-he 
he  he -over our wine-he  he  he   

  THE Amontillado    I said 

  He  he  he -he  he  he -yes  THE Amontillado  But is it not
getting late  Will not THEy be awaiting us at THE palazzo-THE
Lady Fortunato and THE rest  Let us be gone   

  Yes    I said    let us be gone   

  For THE love of God  Montresor   

  Yes    I said    for THE love of God   

But to THEse words I hearkened in vain for a reply  I grew impatient 
I called aloud-

  Fortunato   

No answer  I called again-

  Fortunato   

No answer still  I thrust a torch through THE remaining aperture
and let it fall within  THEre came forth in return only a jingling
of THE bells  My heart grew sick; it was THE dampness of THE catacombs
that made it so  I hastened to make an end of my labour  I forced
THE last stone into its position; I plastered it up  Against THE
new masonry I re-erected THE old rampart of bones  For THE half
of a century no mortal has disturbed THEm  In pace requiescat
